# IBM_Employement_Burnout_Analysis
 - This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee burnout using machine learning techniques. 
 - It identifies key factors influencing burnout and provides actionable insights for organizations to improve employee well-being and productivity.

## Key Features

*Comprehensive Analysis:*

    - Processes data to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numeric features.
    - Includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations.
  
*Machine Learning Models:*

     - Implements multiple models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regressors.
     - Evaluates models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
   
*Actionable Insights:*

     - Highlights critical factors driving employee burnout.
     - Supports decision-making to reduce burnout and improve workplace satisfaction.

## Technologies Used
   - Python
   - Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
   - Jupyter Notebook for code execution and analysis
   - Pickle for model saving
