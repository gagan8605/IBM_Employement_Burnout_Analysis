# IBM_Employement_Burnout_Analysis
 -This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee burnout using machine learning techniques. 
 -It identifies key factors influencing burnout and provides actionable insights for organizations to improve employee well-being and productivity.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive Analysis:

    -Processes data to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numeric features.
    -Includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations.
  
-Machine Learning Models:

   -Implements multiple models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regressors.
   -Evaluates models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
   
-Actionable Insights:

   -Highlights critical factors driving employee burnout.
   -Supports decision-making to reduce burnout and improve workplace satisfaction.

## Technologies Used
-Python
-Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
-Jupyter Notebook for code execution and analysis
-Pickle for model saving

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
